## Features

- **Home screen** — board list with active sprint names and issue statistics
- **Sprint list view** — browse issues in the active sprint with filtering
- **Kanban board view** — status columns with card rendering, scrolling, and parent-based filtering
- **Issue detail view** — metadata, parent issue link, child issues grouped by status with progress bar, description, and comments with full Atlassian wiki markup rendering
- **Status transitions** — move issues between statuses from the issue or board view (`m`)
- **Comments** — post comments from the issue detail view (`c`) with a multi-line editor
- **JQL search** — context-aware autocomplete for fields, operators, values, and keywords, with live user search for assignee/reporter
- **Issue creation** — multi-step wizard to create issues with project/type pickers, priority, assignee search, labels, and parent issue
- **Branch creation** — create branches from issues with configurable mode (local, remote, or both) and title-case or lowercase naming
- **Setup wizard** — interactive first-run configuration with API validation and OS keychain storage
- **Direct issue opening** — pass an issue key as a CLI argument to jump straight to it

---

## Quick Start

```sh
brew install seanhalberthal/tap/jiru
```

---

## Configuration

On first launch, if required credentials are missing, jiru shows an interactive setup wizard that validates credentials against the Jira API and stores the API token in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain or SecretService on Linux). Other settings are saved to `~/.config/jiru/config.env`. Re-open the wizard at any time with `S`.

Configuration is resolved from four sources, in priority order:

1. **Environment variables** — always take precedence
2. **jiru config file** — `~/.config/jiru/config.env` (written by the setup wizard)
3. **Zsh config files** — scans `~/.zshenv`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.secrets.zsh`, `~/.config/secrets.zsh`, and `~/.config/zsh/secrets.zsh` for `export` statements
4. **jira-cli config** — falls back to `~/.config/.jira/.config.yml` for domain, user, and board ID

| Variable | Alias | Purpose | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JIRA_DOMAIN` | `JIRA_URL` | Jira instance domain, e.g. `yourorg.atlassian.net` | Yes |
| `JIRA_USER` | `JIRA_USERNAME` | Atlassian email address | Yes |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | | [API token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) or PAT | Yes |
| `JIRA_AUTH_TYPE` | | `basic` (default) or `bearer` | No |
| `JIRA_BOARD_ID` | | Board ID — skips the home screen when set | No |
| `JIRA_PROJECT` | | Project key to filter the board list | No |
| `JIRA_REPO_PATH` | | Path to local git repo for branch creation | No |
| `JIRA_BRANCH_UPPERCASE` | | `true` for Title-Case branch names (e.g. `PROJ-123-Fix-Login-Bug`) | No |
| `JIRA_BRANCH_MODE` | | Branch creation mode: `local`, `remote`, or `both` (default: `local`) | No |

The aliases (`JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_USERNAME`) provide compatibility with tools like mcp-atlassian that use different variable names. `JIRA_DOMAIN` strips the protocol automatically if provided.

<details>
<summary>Finding your board ID</summary>

The board ID is in the URL when viewing a board in Jira:

```
https://yourorg.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PROJ/boards/123
```

The board ID is `123`.

</details>

## Usage

```sh
jiru              # Launch the TUI
jiru PROJ-123     # Open a specific issue directly
jiru --version    # Print version
jiru --reset      # Reset all config and credentials
```

When `JIRA_BOARD_ID` is set, the app loads the sprint view directly. Otherwise, the home screen shows a list of boards to choose from.
